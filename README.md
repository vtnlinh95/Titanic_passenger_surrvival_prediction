### Titanic Passenger Surrvival Prediction
This is my first assignment with the data set about the passenger who travel on the Titanic.
In this assignment, we use the decision tree to predict whether a passenger is survived or not.

I decide to build my own decision tree use **Iterative Dichotomiser 3**.
I follow the instruction illustrated in this [blog](https://medium.com/deep-math-machine-learning-ai/chapter-4-decision-trees-algorithms-b93975f7a1f1).
It is very good blog for the beginner to learn about some algorithms to choose the features to build a decision tree.
